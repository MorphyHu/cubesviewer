CubesViewer Map Charts
======================

Maps require some extra configuration in order to define the maps will be used and
how data will be represented on them.

Features
--------

- Support geographic data in dimension attributes ~~and fact details~~
- Geographic feature types: points, lines, polygons
- Sources: reference to layer feature, ~~latitude/longitude (x/y), WKT, GeoJSON~~
- Multiple layers
- Layer types: GeoJSON, KML, XYZ

- Configurable view:
  - ~~Automatic bounding box, fixed bounding box, free view~~
  - ~~Configurable min/max zoom level~~

- Representation:
  - Cloropleth
  - ~~Points~~
  - ~~Bubbles (measure as radius)~~
  - ~~Legends~~


Model configuration
-------------------

CubesViewer can represent data on maps on a dimension level basis. As usual,
CubesViewer options are prefixed with `cv-` and must be defined in the
`info` dictionary of the target level.

Reference
---------

This is the list of available options:

Key | Description
--- | -----------
cv-geo-source | Define how the data in the dimension will be mapped to map features. Possible values are 'ref'.
cv-geo-ref-layer | (When using 'ref' as source) Name of the layer with the geographic features to use for representation.
cv-geo-ref-model-attribute | (When using 'ref' as source) Dimension attribute which value will be searched along map features (must be one of the level attributes).
cv-geo-ref-layer-attribute | (When using 'ref' as source) Map feature metadata key to use when matching dimension values.
cv-geo-map-layers | Array of layer definitions. See the *Layers* section below.

Layers
------

Layers are defined inside the `cv-geo-map-layers` metadata attribute, which is an ordered list of layers
which will be drawn bottom to top. Each layer is defined as a dictionary of options (key/value).

There are different *providers* for map layers. Some providers require a web service, others can
work with a simple file (like GeoJSON or KML). The provider type is defined in the `type` attribute.

You need to provide your own map files or services, but the `html/maps` directory contains a few samples.


*Vector (GeoJSON, KML)*

Vector map layers usually contain features. *Features* are the polygons, lines or points that belong
to the layer. Features can have attributes, and where appropriate, they can be used for representation.
(ie. a world map where features are countries can be colored based on CubesViewer data).

```
    {
        "name": "countries",
        "type": "vector",
        "attribution": "&copy; NaturalEarth",
        "params": {
            "url": "maps/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.geo.json",
            "format": "geojson",
            "wrapX": true
        }
    }
```

Vector layers can be read from a variety of formats. Currently, supported `format` values are `geojson` and `kml`.

*XYZ*

XYZ layers require a tile server available to serve map imagery. There are a number of servers
available on the Internet (please note most public servers have usage policies), but you
shall use your own tile server for serious purposes.

```
    {
        "name": "ortophotos",
        "type": "xyz",
        "attribution": "&copy; Attribution Label",
        "params": {
            "url": "http://tile.server.example/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
        }
    }
```


Examples
--------

* Map with two layers (XYZ + GeoJSON), using the GeoJSON vector layer features for representation (`ref` source).

```
   "dimensions": [
        {
            "label": "Country",
            "levels": [
                {
                    "attributes": [
                        "geo_code",
                        "geo_label"
                    ],
                    "key": "geo_code",
                    "label": "Country",
                    "label_attribute": "geo_label",
                    "name": "geo",
                    "role": "geo",
                    "info": {
                        "cv-geo-source": "ref",
                        "cv-geo-ref-layer": "countries",
                        "cv-geo-ref-model-attribute": "geo_code",
                        "cv-geo-ref-layer-attribute": "iso_a2",
                        "cv-geo-map-layers": [ {
                            "name": "ortophotos",
                            "type": "xyz",
                            "attribution": "&copy; Attribution Label",
                            "params": {
                                "url": "http://tile.server.example/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
                            }
                        }, {
                            "name": "countries",
                            "type": "vector",
                            "attribution": "&copy; NaturalEarth",
                            "params": {
                                "url": "maps/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.geo.json",
                                "format": "geojson"
                            }
                        } ]
                    }
                }
            ],
            "name": "geo"
        },
```
